# N-Particle-Simulation-of-Newton-s-Universal-Law-of-Gravitation-Matlab-
This repository was created to share source code from my youtube channel as well as act as a source of information (and learning) for anyone wanting to write their own code.

Some examples of related youtube videos;

List of files in this repository;<br />
outline of theory_equations_algorithms.pdf - information about theory and algorithm used in code
source_code_youtube_videos.m - exact source code for my youtube videos [could be hard to read/interpret and has been largely untouched since 2016 (subject to improvement)]
universial_gravitation(5_Particles).m - simplified demonstration of algorithm used in source_code_youtube_videos.m
universial_gravitation(N_Particles).m - more advanced than universial_gravitation(5_Particles).m

(all .m files were tested in Matlab2013b)
